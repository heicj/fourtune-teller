      <p>Miss Alissa is a world-renowned psychic and fortune-teller hailing from the sparsely-populated state of South Dakota. She discovered her gift at the age of 9 and her powers of divination were passed down from her grandmother to her mother and then to her, out of the 24 children her father had. The source of this inherited power is mostly from a 710-year old Genie, who is gypsy in nature. In 1998, Alissa relocated to the Pacific Northwest to begin practicing. It was here she met a astrophysicist who told her that her fate was “aligned to the stars in heaven”. She now studies the seemingly magical processes of transformation and creation called <del>alchemy</del> software development.</p>

      <p>Mr. Lomax, aka "The Deductionist", comes from generations of future-tellers and illusionists. Growing up in Portland Oregon, Lomax learned to specialize his abilities into mind-reading and fortune-telling. When the other boys were out playing football and hiding in the woods, Lomax was predicting the score and finding their hiding places with psychic accuracy. He’ll know what you’ve had for lunch, where you’ve been that day, what you do for a living, the car you drive, even your PIN code. He’ll read you like a book. For the past month, Jack has been studying the arts of programming at Alchemy Code Lab and was just hired on by the FOURtune tellers this last week. </p>
